# Vector — indexers runbook

Owner: vector team · Source rules: [alerts/vector-indexers.yaml](../../alerts/vector-indexers.yaml)

The Vector indexers (`stl-morpho-indexer`, `stl-oracle-indexer`) are the last
hop in the pipeline before customer-facing data lands in TimescaleDB. They
consume blocks from the watcher and derive product state (positions,
prices). A stall here directly translates to stale downstream reads.

---

## VectorMorphoIndexerStalled / VectorOracleIndexerStalled

**Severity:** critical · **For:** 15m

### What it means

The labelled indexer on the labelled `chain` has processed zero blocks for
15 minutes. Downstream TimescaleDB state for Morpho positions / oracle
prices is going stale.

### First checks (≤5 min)

1. **Pod status** — run the one matching the firing alert:
   - Morpho: `kubectl -n vector get pods -l app=stl-morpho-indexer`
   - Oracle: `kubectl -n vector get pods -l app=stl-oracle-indexer`
2. **Recent logs** — look for decode panics, DB connection errors, or
   `context deadline exceeded` against the watcher's archive RPC.
3. **Upstream lag** — confirm the watcher is producing for this chain (if
   not, fix that first — that's `VectorWatcherNoBlocks`).
4. **TimescaleDB health** — connection pool exhaustion or replication lag
   can stall writes; check the Postgres dashboard.

### Common causes

- Indexer stuck on a malformed event after a contract upgrade → add the new
  ABI / decoder and redeploy.
- DB connection pool saturated → restart the pod; longer-term raise the
  pool limit.
- Watcher archive RPC slow → see `VectorMorphoIndexerRPCLatencyHigh`.

### Verify recovery

`rate({morpho,oracle}_blocks_processed_total) > 0` for the affected chain.

---

## VectorMorphoIndexerErrorsHigh / VectorOracleIndexerErrorsHigh

**Severity:** warning · **For:** 15m

### What it means

The labelled indexer is logging more than 0.1 errors/sec sustained for
15 minutes. Investigate before it escalates to a full stall.

### First checks

- Inspect recent logs for the dominant error class.
- Correlate with recent deploys (`kubectl rollout history`).
- Check for chain reorgs in the watcher logs — indexers may need to roll
  back state.

---

## VectorMorphoIndexerRPCLatencyHigh / VectorOracleIndexerRPCLatencyHigh

**Severity:** warning · **For:** 15m

### What it means

p99 RPC request latency from the indexer (to the watcher's archive RPC) is
over 3 seconds sustained for 15 minutes. The indexer is degraded; expect
downstream lag.

### First checks

- Watcher RPC pod health and CPU usage.
- Network latency between the indexer node group and the watcher service.
- Recent changes in batch size / pagination defaults.

## maple-graphql-indexer (VEC-320)

Unlike morpho/oracle, `maple-graphql-indexer` is **not** a block consumer. It
is a Temporal cron (default 10m, `MAPLE_SYNC_INTERVAL`) that snapshots the
public Maple GraphQL API (`api.maple.finance/v2/graphql`) into TimescaleDB:
pools, active open-term loans + collateral, Sky strategies, Syrup globals.
There are no blocks and no RPC — the upstream is the Maple API, and "stale"
means the borrower-risk snapshot tables stop advancing. Single replica;
mainnet-only (`chain="ethereum"`).

Phases run per cycle, each in its own transaction: `pools` → `loans` →
`sky_strategies` → `syrup_globals`. A failed `pools` phase skips `loans` and
`sky_strategies` (they depend on the pool registry).

---

## VectorMapleIndexerStalled

**Severity:** critical · **For:** 15m

### What it means

No sync cycle has completed for >20m (two missed 10m intervals).
`maple_sync_cycles_total` (incremented on both success and error) is flat, so
the Maple snapshot tables are going stale.

### First checks (≤5 min)

1. **Is `VectorMapleIndexerDown` also firing?**
   - **Yes** → the pod is not running; this is a process death. Go to that
     runbook section — it's the root cause.
   - **No** → the pod is alive but not producing. Two likely causes:
     **(a)** the cron worker is wedged, or **(b)** the OTLP/metrics pipeline
     broke and the indexer is actually fine (this shape false-fired in
     VEC-360). Disambiguate with the next two steps.
2. **Pod + logs** — `kubectl -n vector logs -l app=maple-graphql-indexer --tail=100`.
   Healthy cycles log `pools synced` / `loans synced` / `syrup globals synced`
   every ~10m. If those lines are recent, the indexer is fine and the metrics
   pipeline is the problem (check the OTel collector in `observability`).
3. **Temporal** — confirm the schedule is firing: workflow IDs
   `scheduled-maple-graphql-indexer-<ts>` should appear each interval. If the
   worker lost its Temporal connection, restart the pod.
4. **Upstream** — `curl -s -XPOST https://api.maple.finance/v2/graphql` reachable?
   A hard Maple outage stalls every cycle (cycles still *run*, so this presents
   as cycle/phase errors too).

### Common causes

- OTLP export broken, indexer healthy (VEC-360) → fix the metrics pipeline, not
  the cron; logs are the source of truth.
- Temporal worker wedged / lost connection → restart the pod.
- Sustained Maple API outage → cycles fail; see `VectorMaplePhaseErrors`.

### Verify recovery

`rate(maple_sync_cycles_total[20m]) > 0`, and a fresh `synced_at` lands:
`SELECT max(synced_at) FROM maple_pool_state;` within the last interval.

---

## VectorMapleIndexerDown

**Severity:** critical · **For:** 10m

### What it means

The `maple-graphql-indexer` Deployment has <1 available replica for >10m
(kube-state-metrics, independent of the indexer's own OTLP export). The cron
worker is not running; no snapshots are taken. If `VectorMapleIndexerStalled`
is firing too, **this is the root cause.**

### First checks (≤5 min)

1. `kubectl -n vector get deploy,pods -l app=maple-graphql-indexer` — pod state
   and restart count.
2. **Not Running?** describe for the reason:
   `kubectl -n vector describe pod -l app=maple-graphql-indexer | sed -n '/Events:/,$p'`
   - `CreateContainerConfigError` / `CreateContainerError` → missing config or
     secret; check the `maple-graphql-indexer` ConfigMap and ExternalSecret.
   - `CrashLoopBackOff` → read logs; common: bad `DATABASE_URL`, unreachable
     TimescaleDB, or a startup panic.
   - `Pending` / `FailedScheduling` → no node capacity; check the node group.
3. **ExternalSecret synced?**
   `kubectl -n vector get externalsecret maple-graphql-indexer` — a failed sync
   leaves the pod unable to start.

### Common causes

- Missing/failed ExternalSecret (DB creds) → fix the secret, pod recovers.
- Crash on startup (DB unreachable, config) → fix the dependency.
- Node scaled away with no rescheduling capacity → check the node group /
  autoscaler.

### Verify recovery

`kube_deployment_status_replicas_available{deployment="maple-graphql-indexer"} == 1`
and cycles resume (see Stalled recovery check).

## VectorMapleIndexerCycleErrors / VectorMaplePhaseErrors

**Severity:** warning · **For:** 0m (the 30m window debounces)

### What it means

Cycles are running but failing. `CycleErrors` is the rollup (also catches
pre-phase setup failures: protocol seed, DB connection); `PhaseErrors` names
the failing `phase` and is the actionable one. Per-phase transactions mean
surviving phases still commit — data is **partial, not absent**, so this warns
rather than pages.

### First checks

1. **Which phase** — `sum by (phase) (increase(maple_sync_phases_total{status="error"}[30m]))`.
2. **Logs** for that phase — `kubectl -n vector logs -l app=maple-graphql-indexer`.
   Errors name the owning entity (e.g. `pool 0x… : …`).
3. **Cascade check** — a failing `pools` phase deliberately skips `loans` and
   `sky_strategies`; fix `pools` first.

### Common causes

- Maple API returning Apollo `errors[]`, 429/5xx, or unstable pagination
  (duplicate IDs across pages) → usually transient; confirm it clears next cycle.
- A string-encoded integer field the client can't parse → the phase fails hard
  by design (never silently skips rows); needs a client fix.
- DB write failure (FK, constraint) → inspect the named entity.

---

## VectorMaplePoolWritesZero

**Severity:** warning · **For:** 15m

### What it means

Cycles are running but the `pools` phase wrote 0 rows over 20m. There are
always ~21 PoolV2 pools, so 0 means Maple's `poolV2S` query returned an empty
(but HTTP 200, no-error) collection — a silent upstream regression the error
alerts do **not** catch. (This is gated on "cycling AND zero" so it doesn't
just duplicate `Stalled`.)

### First checks

- Query the API directly for `poolV2S` and confirm it returns pools.
- Check `maple-graphql-client` logs for `fetched paginated collection
  collection=pools total_rows=0`.
- If Maple changed the query shape/field names, the client needs updating.

> Note: do **not** expect an equivalent for loans — the service legitimately
> records 0 loan rows when there are no active loans, so loan-zero is normal.

---

## VectorMapleSchemaDrift

**Severity:** warning · **For:** 0m (1h window debounces)

### What it means

A field Maple normally populates (`pool_monthly_apy`, `pool_spot_apy`,
`strategy_fee_rate`, `strategy_total_fees_collected`) was null-downgraded to
SQL NULL repeatedly (>5/1h). Known-nullable fields (`loan_acm_ratio`,
`pool_tvl`, `pool_collateral_value_usd`, `syrup_drips_yield_boost`) are
excluded. A sustained count signals a Maple GraphQL API schema change, not a
code bug.

### First checks

- `sum by (field) (increase(maple_sync_null_downgrades_total[1h]))` — which
  field(s).
- Cross-check the field against Maple's published SDL / docs.
- Inspect rows: `SELECT * FROM maple_pool_state WHERE <field> IS NULL ORDER BY
  synced_at DESC LIMIT 20;` — confirm the API, not our parsing, dropped it.

### Action

If Maple intentionally made the field nullable, move it to the excluded set and
re-baseline (ORB-145). If it's an upstream regression, raise with Maple and
decide whether downstream consumers tolerate the gap. The allowlist and the
`>5/1h` threshold are pre-baseline estimates — tune off a few days of data.

## VectorMaplePhaseLatencyHigh

**Severity:** warning · **For:** 15m

### What it means

A phase p95 duration exceeded 30s over 15m. Normal p95 is seconds (loans ~4s,
others <1s) and is essentially Maple API response time — there is no RPC here.
30s is generous for ~150 rows/cycle; sustained latency this high means the
Maple API is degraded and a phase risks overrunning the 10m interval.

### First checks

- `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum by (phase, le) (rate(maple_sync_phase_duration_seconds_bucket[15m])))`
  — which phase.
- Maple API status / response times (curl a representative query).
- If it's the `loans` phase, pagination volume may have grown; check
  `total_rows` in the client logs.

## curve-indexer (VEC-260)

## VectorCurveIndexerStalled

**Severity:** critical · **For:** 15m

### What it means

`curve_blocks_processed_total` has not incremented for 15 minutes on the
labelled `chain`. The Curve pool state in TimescaleDB is going stale; no swap
or liquidity events are being recorded.

### First checks (<=5 min)

1. **Pod status**
   `kubectl -n vector get pods -l app=curve-indexer`
2. **Recent logs** — look for decode panics, DB connection errors,
   `context deadline exceeded`, or SQS poll failures:
   `kubectl -n vector logs -l app=curve-indexer --tail=100`
3. **Upstream lag** — confirm the watcher is producing blocks for this chain
   (if not, the root cause is upstream — see `VectorWatcherNoBlocks`).
4. **SQS queue depth** — check the curve-indexer SQS queue. A depth of 0 with
   no processing means the consumer lost its connection or the queue is empty.
5. **TimescaleDB health** — connection pool exhaustion or replication lag can
   stall writes; check the Postgres dashboard.

### Common causes

- Indexer stuck on a malformed event after a contract upgrade -> add the new
  ABI / decoder and redeploy.
- DB connection pool saturated -> restart the pod; longer-term raise the pool
  limit.
- SQS consumer lost connection -> pod restart reconnects.
- Block latency high enough that the worker is processing but not completing
  within the 5m rate window (see `VectorCurveIndexerBlockLatencyHigh`).

### Verify recovery

`rate(curve_blocks_processed_total[5m]) > 0` for the affected chain.

---

## VectorCurveIndexerErrorsHigh

**Severity:** warning · **For:** 15m

### What it means

`curve_errors_total` is above 0.1 errors/sec sustained for 15 minutes. Errors
are counted per operation (attribute `operation`); the indexer continues
processing but errors at this rate often precede a full stall.

### First checks

1. **Dominant error class** — `sum by (operation)(rate(curve_errors_total[10m]))`
   to see which operation is failing most.
2. **Pod logs** — `kubectl -n vector logs -l app=curve-indexer | grep "ERROR"`
3. **Recent deploys** — `kubectl rollout history deploy/curve-indexer -n vector`.
   A failed ABI decode after a contract change is a common trigger.
4. **Chain reorgs** — check watcher logs; a reorg delivers blocks the indexer
   may reject until the version advances.

### Common causes

- ABI decode failure after a Curve contract upgrade -> update the ABI/decoder.
- DB write error (FK constraint, duplicate key) -> inspect the failing pool and
  block number.
- Transient RPC timeout -> usually self-clears; investigate if sustained.

### Verify recovery

`rate(curve_errors_total[10m]) == 0` for the affected chain.

## VectorCurveIndexerBlockLatencyHigh

**Severity:** warning · **For:** 15m

### What it means

p99 block processing duration (`curve_block_duration_seconds`) exceeds 3
seconds sustained for 15 minutes. The indexer is degraded; expect downstream
lag in Curve pool state.

### First checks

1. **Multicall/RPC latency** — the Coordinator's `SnapshotState` calls issue
   batched multicalls to the archive RPC. High latency there dominates block
   duration. Check the archive RPC pod health and CPU.
2. **Pool count** — a large `snapshotSet` (many touched pools or heartbeat
   firing on all pools) multiplies multicall round-trips. Check
   `HeartbeatBlocks` config and pool count.
3. **DB write latency** — confirm TimescaleDB is not under I/O pressure.
4. **Pod CPU/memory** — `kubectl top pod -n vector -l app=curve-indexer`.

### Common causes

- Archive RPC node degraded -> coordinate with infra; consider circuit-
  breaker or fallback RPC.
- Heartbeat interval too short for pool count -> raise `HEARTBEAT_BLOCKS`.
- TimescaleDB I/O contention -> investigate concurrent write patterns.

### Verify recovery

`histogram_quantile(0.99, sum by (le)(rate(curve_block_duration_seconds_bucket[10m]))) < 3`
for the affected chain.

---

## VectorCurveIndexerNoStateWritten

**Severity:** warning · **For:** 30m

### What it means

Blocks are advancing (`curve_blocks_processed_total{status="success"}` is
non-zero) but no pool-state snapshot rows have been written
(`curve_state_rows_written_total` is zero) for 30 minutes. The error path will
NOT catch this: a quietly-empty snapshot loop (e.g. `buildSnapshotSet` always
returns empty, heartbeat disabled and no touched pools, or all pools skipped)
produces no errors, just no state rows.

This is the data-quality / silent-empty check that `VectorCurveIndexerStalled`
cannot see.

### First checks

1. **HeartbeatBlocks config** — if `HEARTBEAT_BLOCKS=0` (disabled) and no
   blocks contain Curve events, `buildSnapshotSet` legitimately returns empty.
   Confirm there is genuine pool activity on-chain or re-enable heartbeat.
2. **Touched pools** — check whether any registered pool addresses match logs
   in the processed blocks. `kubectl logs -l app=curve-indexer` should show
   pool-touch debug entries (or absence thereof).
3. **Pool registry** — if the pool list is empty (LoadPools returned 0 rows),
   `buildSnapshotSet` can never produce entries. Confirm the DB has rows in
   `curve_pool`.
4. **snapshotSet size metric** is not separately emitted; use
   `curve_state_rows_written_total` as the proxy. A sudden drop to zero after
   previously non-zero is more urgent than a fresh deploy with no history.

### Common causes

- `HEARTBEAT_BLOCKS=0` and no Curve events on this chain in 30m (legitimate
  low-activity window) -> confirm on-chain before escalating.
- Pool registry empty (migration not applied, wrong chain ID) -> verify
  `SELECT count(*) FROM curve_pool WHERE chain_id = <id>`.
- Contract address mismatch (new pool deployed at different address) -> update
  the pool registry.

### Verify recovery

`rate(curve_state_rows_written_total[30m]) > 0` for the affected chain, or
confirm on-chain that no Curve activity occurred (legitimate quiet window).
